Best Fit allocates the smallest available memory block that is large enough to satisfy the request.

When a process requires memory, the OS scans the entire list of available memory blocks.
It finds the block that is the closest fit for the processâ€™s memory requirement 
(i.e., the smallest block that can accommodate the request).
If found, the process is placed in that block; any leftover space becomes a smaller free block.

Advantages:
Minimizes Wasted Space: By choosing the smallest suitable block, it reduces the amount of unused memory left over.
Disadvantages:
High Fragmentation: Over time, this can create many small memory fragments, 
leading to memory that is unusable for larger processes.
Slower Allocation: Needs to scan all blocks to find the best fit, which can slow down allocation time.
