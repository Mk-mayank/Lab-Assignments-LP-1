Shortest Job First (SJF) Preemptive Scheduling, also known as Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), 
is a CPU scheduling algorithm where the process with the shortest remaining burst time is 
selected for execution. Unlike non-preemptive SJF,
SRTF can interrupt a running process if a new process arrives with a shorter burst time.

In SRTF, the CPU always picks the process with the shortest remaining time, which means that 
a running process may be interrupted if another process with a shorter burst time arrives.

Similar to non-preemptive SJF, SRTF can lead to starvation for longer processes if shorter 
jobs keep arriving. Long processes may experience excessive delays in execution.

SRTF requires continuous monitoring of remaining burst times to select the next job, 
making it more complex to implement than non-preemptive SJF.
The scheduler must decide in real-time whether to switch to a new process.


-- Usecase

Operating System Task Scheduling for Interactive User Tasks:

When a user opens a small app or initiates a lightweight task
(e.g., checking notifications or opening a menu), the operating system prioritizes these quick tasks
interrupting longer background processes like system updates, backups, or large file transfers.
