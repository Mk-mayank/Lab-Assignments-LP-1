Processes are scheduled based on priority; higher-priority processes are selected first.

In non-preemptive scheduling, once a process starts executing, 
it runs to completion without interruption, regardless of new processes arriving with higher priority.

Non-preemptive scheduling is simpler to implement compared to 
preemptive scheduling as there’s no need to constantly check for higher-priority processes.

Since a process runs to completion once it starts, there’s less context switching,
reducing the overhead associated with frequent task switching.

Lower-priority processes may experience starvation if higher-priority processes continue arriving,
delaying their execution indefinitely.
