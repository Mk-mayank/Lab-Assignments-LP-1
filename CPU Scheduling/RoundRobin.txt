Round Robin (RR) Scheduling is a preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm commonly used in 
time-sharing and multitasking operating systems. In this algorithm, each process is 
assigned a fixed time slice (or "quantum") during which it can run. 
If a process does not finish within its time quantum, it is preempted and placed 
back in the ready queue, allowing the next process in line to use the CPU. The cycle 
continues until all processes are complete.

Round Robin is inherently preemptive, meaning processes are interrupted and 
moved back to the ready queue if they exceed their time quantum.

RR scheduling is generally considered fair because each process receives equal 
CPU time in a cyclic order, avoiding starvation.

Round Robin is widely used in time-sharing systems where the goal is to allow multiple 
users or applications to interact with the system almost simultaneously.

Modern OS task schedulers use Round Robin to manage multiple processes, ensuring that no 
single task monopolizes the CPU.

Round Robin is also applied in network routers and switches to process data packets from
multiple sources fairly. This ensures that all network flows get equal access to bandwidth, improving overall network performance.
