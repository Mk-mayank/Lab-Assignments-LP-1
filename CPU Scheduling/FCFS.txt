FCFS Theory :

This is the simplest CPU scheduling algorithm.
In the FCFS scheduling algorithm, the process that arrives first is executed first.
FCFS is non-preemptive, meaning once a process starts its execution, 
it runs to completion before the next process can start.

Advantages: Easy to implement.

Disadvantages: It may lead to the "convoy effect", leading to poor CPU utilization and
high average wait times if long processes are executed before short ones.

How It Works:

Maintain a queue of processes.
When the CPU is free, dispatch the process at the front of the queue.
New processes are appended at the end of the queue.
